## Movie Listings Challenge
Built with React and the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) starter kit and Axios. 

## Rating Filter

To work on the Rating filter, I did the following:
- Create an initial rating state in Rating component and set it to 3.
- Set the range input value as the rating state.
- Push the state up to the App parent component.
- Pass rating state as prop to MovieList component.
- When the rating state is less than the vote_average.

## Genre Filter

To work on the Genre filter, I did the following:
- Create a filteredGenres state object and add an array for each Genre ID.
- Map over each array in Movies state and spread in new property for visibility and set to true.
- When a genre checkbox is selected, run a function to add selected genre ID to the filteredGenres state.
- If the movie state genreIDs match the genreFilter state, set visibility flag property to true.
- When rendering movies, filter only the the movies in state with visibility set to true and then display.

I will keep working on this as and when I can as I really want to work out how to do it.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
